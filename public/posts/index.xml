      <description>The question of what code readability is (as part of mystical DX in general) is often raised lately. And more and more people have started to say that readability is purely a matter of preference. I can&amp;rsquo;t blame them. After many years of development, we may catch ourselves thinking that we are already quite capable of perceiving different code of various quality, paradigms and languages. We can also get used to tools that at first seemed uncomfortable to us.</description>

      <description>14 min read. Source: trust me bro. What a lovely title to start an article. But don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong â€” this is not a clickbait. And yes, I&amp;rsquo;m going to name-drop some technologies and names here and there. Not to tarnish their reputation, but to better reveal a thought that has haunted me for a long time.
In addition, this article is not a marketing one and is not intended to promote some other magic pill.</description>
